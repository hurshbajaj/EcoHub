### EcoHub
An interactive platform encouraging users towarda a cleaner environment with a cleaner eco trail!

Simply log into your account, (once verified, clicking on log in or sign up will redirect you to the main hub)

This is where you'll be able to see all the entries / requests users have submitted. Basically, the point of this platform is for users to share their good deeds towards mother nature and earn cool prizes in return!

Admins go over these requests every month and award points to those whom they believe genuinely helped move society on the basis of the proof / description. To submit such a request of your own, simply choose request, from there you'd be able to browse through the available options ("Click Me") including "other", set the amt / quantity of how much you have done that action and finally set a description / share proof of your work in the form of a google drive or so. Note: for "other", default base points remain 0, so kindly mention the amt of points u expect for doing the same in the desc. Once you have gained enough points, you can use the market place to buy cool items!
